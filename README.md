## The following information will consist of the 4 algorithms that are running in assignment_1 and testing them in test_assignment_1

Purpose: Each algorithm explores 4 different ways to find the roots of difficult polynomials

The project here has requirements.txt, which will list the packages and python version utilized in order to run the functions

Algorithms Programed: Approximation Method, Bisection, Fixed-Point Iteration, Newton's Method

Software: Uploaded to Github and coded in python on Eclipse

Each algorithm will output the corresponding roots based on equations from the following pseudocode or java examples from powerpoint slides with parameters:
- Approximation: x0 (initial guess), tol (tolerance)
- Bisection: f (function), left/right (left and right interval bounds), max (maximum # of iterations), tol (tolerance)
- Fixed-Point: g (function), p0 (initial guess), tol (tolerance), n0 (max # of iterations)
- Newton: h/h_p (function and derivative), p_prev (initial approx.), tol (tolerance), n0 (max # of iterations)
